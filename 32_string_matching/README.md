## 32\. String Matching {#32-string-matching}

There four string matching algorithms that will be discussed. Each of them differ in performance.

| Algorithm | Preprocessing Time | Processing Time |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Naive | 0 | formula |
| Rabin Karp |  | formula |
| Finite automaton | formula | formula |
| Knuth-Morris-Pratt | formula | formula |

Where, **n** is length of term, **m** is length of pattern, and **Î£** is number of alphabet that formed pattern.
